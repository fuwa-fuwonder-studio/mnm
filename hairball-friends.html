      <p>Hairball Friends are tiny, whimsical creatures born from the fluffy fur of our beloved Furry Friends.

Each one carries a small spark of personality, quirky, gentle, mysterious, or wise, 
and together they try their best to build a peaceful, soft-hearted world.

They don’t always succeed, but they always try.
And that’s what makes them who they are.</p>
