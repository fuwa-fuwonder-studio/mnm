          <p class="Why-I-built-this-app-text">My Furry Friends began with Snuffy.<br>When I decided to bring her home,<br>I wanted a place where I could gently record her journey,<br>from a difficult past into a soft, happy life.<br><br>I also wished I could check on the pets I love:<br>the cat and rabbit at my family home in Japan,<br>and the animals my friends worry about when they’re away.<br>Even with pet sitters, the quiet anxiety never fully disappears.<br><br>So I wanted a small, safe space where I could keep my own memories<br>and share real-time moments with the people who love their pets just as much.<br><br>That wish became this app.</p>

          <h3 class="The-world-of-MFF-grid">A place without competition or noise.</h3>
          <p class="The-world-of-MFF-text">There are no likes, scores, or rankings here.<br>Just simple, honest snapshots of the pets we love.<br>You can share real-time updates or quietly keep your own memories,<br>both are equally welcome.</p>
          <h3 class="The-world-of-MFF-grid">Designed to make you feel at ease.</h3>

 <!-- ========== How it works ========== -->
    <section class="How-it-was-made-section">
      <div class="How-it-was-made">
        <h2 class="How-it-was-made-Title"> How it was made</h2>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">Built with quiet craftsmanship, one soft step at a time.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">Although My Furry Friends feels gentle on the surface, its world is supported by careful engineering and thoughtful design.<br>
The app was created slowly—through patient nights of adjusting, testing, and choosing only the elements that would keep the experience calm.</p>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">Native foundations for a soft, natural feel.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">The entire app is crafted natively in Swift and Xcode, so gestures feel light, screens respond instantly, and the experience stays as smooth as the world it represents.<br>
Nothing is automated or templated, every part is intentionally shaped by hand.</p>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">A private memory library beneath the surface.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">Photos and updates settle into a quietly organized system built on Firebase.<br>
The database structure was designed to keep loading gentle and fast, even as memories accumulate.<br>
Timelines reflect real-time changes because pets live in real time, and their tiny moments deserve to appear just as they happen.</p>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">Protected gates and layered safeguards.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">To preserve the calm of this world, access is controlled through secure authentication, ensuring only invited people can enter.<br>
Behind the scenes, Firebase Security Rules act as silent shields, protecting each photo and preventing anything from being seen by someone it wasn’t meant for.<br>
Peace in this world isn’t an accident, it’s maintained by design.</p>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">Designed through reduction, not addition.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">Creating MFF wasn’t about adding features; it was about removing everything that could disturb the softness.<br>
No likes, no rankings, no crowded interactions.<br>
Just the essential tools to record and share a quiet life without pressure or comparison.</p>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">Shaped by the real lives who inspired it.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">Every decision was guided by real animals and real concerns, Snuffy’s gentle journey into a new home, the pets at my family house, and the worries of friends checking on their companions from afar.<br>
Their lives shaped the architecture, the design, and the way this world moves.</p>
        <h3 class="How-it-was-made-grid">A small, softly engineered world made with care.</h3>
        <p class="How-it-was-made-text">MFF may look simple, but the simplicity is deliberate, built from countless thoughtful choices
so that the world you see can remain peaceful, and the memories you keep can stay warm.</p>
